# Project Rules (Android)
## 1. Communication & Language
- Language of Interaction: All explanations, answers, suggestions, and questions must be provided in Korean (한글).

- Code Comments: Use Korean for code comments where necessary to enhance the developer's understanding of the logic.

- Terminology: Technical terms, variable names, and class names must strictly follow standard English programming terminology.

## 2. Tech Stack & Environment
- Language & Framework: Use Kotlin as the primary language and Jetpack Compose for all UI development.

- Minimum SDK: Target Android 8.0 (API Level 26) or higher, aiming for the latest stable versions.

- Build Tool: Use Gradle (Kotlin DSL, .gradle.kts) with Version Catalog (libs.versions.toml) for dependency management.

- Key Libraries: Use Coroutines for asynchronous tasks, Retrofit2 for networking, and Hilt for Dependency Injection (DI).

## 3. Architecture & Multi-Module Structure
- Clean Architecture with Multi-Module: Strictly separate the project into the following modules to ensure concerns are isolated:

- domain: A pure Kotlin module containing Business Logic and Entities (No external dependencies).

- data: Contains Repository implementations, API calls, and local database handling.

- presentation: Contains Jetpack Compose UI, ViewModels, and UI state management.

- app: Responsible for module assembly, Application class, and Hilt configurations.

- Dependency Flow: Maintain a unidirectional dependency flow: Presentation -> Domain <- Data (Applying Dependency Inversion Principle - DIP).

## 4. Efficiency & Operations (Anti-Gravity Engine)
- Standard Structure Compliance: Adhere strictly to the defined project structure, including UI templates, API communication standards, and advertisement integration logic to ensure consistency.

- Server-Driven Strategy: Prioritize relying on Server API data for functional control and content changes. This design must enable instant updates and operational responses without requiring app store re-submission.

## 5. Coding Style & UI
- Declarative UI: All layouts must be written using Jetpack Compose @Composable functions instead of XML.

- State Management: Manage UI states using StateFlow to ensure an observable and reactive data flow.

- Naming Convention: Use lowerCamelCase for variables and methods, and UpperCamelCase for classes and Composable functions.

- Immutability: Prefer val for all variables to minimize side effects; use var only when absolutely necessary.

## 6. Response & Error Handling
- User Feedback: Provide clear Korean messages (via Snackbar, Toast, etc.) to the user in case of network errors or exceptions.

- Result Wrapper: Wrap API results in Result<T> or a custom UiState class to explicitly handle Loading, Success, and Failure states.

## 7. Interaction & Command Execution (STRICT)
- Pre-Execution Explanation: Before suggesting or executing any terminal command (e.g., ./gradlew assembleDebug), you MUST provide a detailed explanation in Korean regarding what the command does and why it is necessary.

- No Direct Prompts: Do not simply list a command followed by "Run command?". You must provide context and expected outcomes in Korean first.

- Interpretation: For any English system logs (Logcat) or error messages, interpret and summarize them in Korean to ensure the user fully understands the situation.
